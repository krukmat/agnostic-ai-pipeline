# Loop Release Workflow ‚Äì AGNOSTIC AI PIPELINE üèóÔ∏è

**Deliver finished products through repeatable BA ‚Üí Product Owner ‚Üí Architect ‚Üí Dev ‚Üí QA release loops.**

---

## Why Loop Releases Matter

- Wraps the entire multi-agent pipeline into a single iteration artifact.
- Guarantees every release includes stories, code, tests, QA evidence, and reproducible state.
- Enables strict or exploratory runs (QA strict vs relaxed) while preserving audit trails.
- Simple to operate (`make iteration ...`), powerful enough for enterprise backlogs, and extensible to any professional or hobby setup.

---

## Example Release Scenarios

| Scenario | Goal | Command |
| -------- | ---- | ------- |
| **CoffeeClub Inventory & Ordering** | Strict inventory/ordering flow with real-time dashboards | `make iteration CONCEPT="CoffeeClub Inventory & Ordering" LOOPS=2 ALLOW_NO_TESTS=0` |
| **E-commerce MVP** | Quick prototype with relaxed QA to explore UI variants | `make iteration CONCEPT="Retail MVP" LOOPS=1 ALLOW_NO_TESTS=1 ITERATION_NAME="explore-retail"` |
| **Mobile Companion App** | Leverage a React Native skeleton added to `project-defaults/` | `make iteration CONCEPT="Courier Mobile Companion" LOOPS=2 SKIP_BA=0` |
| **API Hardening Sprint** | Re-run architect/dev/qa using existing requirements | `make iteration CONCEPT="API Hardening" LOOPS=3 SKIP_BA=1` |
| **Localized Content Update** | Switch Dev role to Codex CLI for domain-specific models | `make set-role role=dev provider=codex_cli model="codex-local"`<br>`make iteration CONCEPT="Localized Content Refresh" LOOPS=2` |

These examples illustrate how loop releases stay **simple (single make command)**, **powerful (full BA‚ÜíQA automation)**, and **extensible (drop in new skeletons or providers)** across professional or amateur environments.

## 1. End-to-End Process Model

The pipeline coordinates five specialised roles. Each emits artifacts that become the inputs for the next role, ensuring traceability from concept to QA evidence.

    Concept["Business Concept\n(CONCEPT env)"] --> BA["Business Analyst\nscripts/run_ba.py\n‚Üí planning/requirements.yaml"]
    BA --> PO["Product Owner\nscripts/run_product_owner.py\n‚Üí planning/product_vision.yaml\n‚Üí planning/product_owner_review.yaml"]
    PO --> ARCH["Architect\nscripts/run_architect.py\n‚Üí PRD, architecture, epics, stories, tasks"]
    ARCH --> DEV["Developer\nscripts/run_dev.py\n‚Üí project/ code & tests\n‚Üí artifacts/dev/*"]

    QA -->|pass| Snapshot["Snapshot & Summary\nartifacts/iterations/<name>/"]
    QA -->|fail| ARCH
```

### Role Responsibilities

| Role | Primary Script | Key Inputs | Key Outputs | Decision Points |
| ---- | -------------- | ---------- | ----------- | --------------- |
| Business Analyst | `scripts/run_ba.py` | `CONCEPT` (env) | `planning/requirements.yaml` + metadata (`meta.original_request`) | Defines initial scope and measurable requirements |
| Product Owner | `scripts/run_product_owner.py` | Concept, requirements, previous vision | `planning/product_vision.yaml`, `planning/product_owner_review.yaml` | Validates alignment; flags gaps or conflicts before planning |
| Architect | `scripts/run_architect.py` | Concept (from requirements) | `planning/prd.yaml`, `architecture.yaml`, `epics.yaml`, `stories.yaml`, `tasks.csv` | Adjusts stories based on QA feedback, honours PO vision |
| Developer | `scripts/run_dev.py` | `planning/stories.yaml` | Application code & automated tests under `project/`, per-story diffs in `artifacts/dev/` | Retries up to `DEV_RETRIES`; blocked stories documented |
| QA Analyst | `scripts/run_qa.py` | Codebase + tests | `artifacts/qa/last_report.json`, per-story logs in `artifacts/qa/story_logs/` | Auto-fixes import paths, enforces TDD, classifies severity |

### Execution Timeline per Iteration

1. **Concept definition** ‚Äì Provide a clear business description by exporting `CONCEPT="..."`.
2. **BA stage** ‚Äì Run `make ba` (or let `make iteration` call it) to produce the structured requirements.
3. **PO validation** ‚Äì Execute `make po` to update the product vision and confirm alignment.
4. **Architect planning** ‚Äì `make plan` creates the delivery backlog from the approved requirements.
5. **Development loop** ‚Äì `make loop MAX_LOOPS=<N>` cycles through Dev/QA with architect interventions:
   - QA failures labelled `force_applicable` require `>= pipeline.force_approval_attempts` Dev retries (default 3) on P1/P0 stories before safe force approval.
   - Non-critical test-only failures hold the story in `blocked_test_only` for manual Dev fixes.
6. **Snapshot & review** ‚Äì `make iteration CONCEPT="..." LOOPS=<N>` encapsulates steps 2‚Äì5 and stores outputs under `artifacts/iterations/`.

### Recommended Command Sequence

```bash
# 1. Capture requirements and vision
CONCEPT="Mid-market social tagging assistant" make ba
CONCEPT="Mid-market social tagging assistant" make po

# 2. Generate technical plan
CONCEPT="Mid-market social tagging assistant" make plan

# 3. Execute development/QA loop
make loop MAX_LOOPS=5

# Optional: clean artifacts or reset workspace
make clean                 # removes artifacts/*
FLUSH=1 make clean         # also empties planning/ and project/
```

Use `artifact/qa/story_logs/<story>.log` to investigate repeated QA failures, and `planning/product_owner_review.yaml` to reconcile BA requirements with the product vision across iterations.

---

## 2. Loop Release at a Glance

```bash
make iteration CONCEPT="Login MVP" LOOPS=2 ITERATION_NAME="release-2025Q1"
```

- **CONCEPT** ‚Äì Plain-text business goal consumed by BA and Architect.
- **LOOPS** ‚Äì Number of Dev‚ÜíQA passes in the iteration (defaults to 1).
- **ITERATION_NAME** ‚Äì Human-readable label for snapshots under `artifacts/iterations/`.
- **ALLOW_NO_TESTS** ‚Äì Set to `0` for strict QA, `1` for exploratory prototyping.
- **SKIP_BA / SKIP_PLAN** ‚Äì Reuse existing requirements/stories without re-running those roles.

Each call orchestrates BA ‚Üí Product Owner ‚Üí Architect ‚Üí Dev ‚Üí QA, snapshots the full state, and writes a `summary.json` with story status counts and configuration flags.

---

## 2. Release Loop Lifecycle

1. **Concept intake** ‚Äì BA converts the concept into requirements (`planning/requirements.yaml`).
2. **Architecture & stories** ‚Äì Architect creates PRD, architecture, epics, stories, and tasks.
3. **Development** ‚Äì Dev agent iterates through stories, updating `project/` code and tests.
4. **Quality gate** ‚Äì QA executes pytest/Jest suites and enforces TDD:
   - Missing tests ‚Üí `blocked_no_tests`
   - Test failures ‚Üí `in_review` + auto Architect adjustment (`ARCHITECT_INTERVENTION=1`)
   - Severity-based force approval allowed after ‚â•3 retries on P1/P0 stories
5. **Snapshot** ‚Äì `artifacts/iterations/<iteration>/` stores planning, project, and `summary.json`.
6. **Follow-up** ‚Äì Use `make loop MAX_LOOPS=1` to retry blocked stories with the refined criteria.

## 3. Anatomy of a Snapshot

```
artifacts/iterations/<iteration-name>/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ planning/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.yaml
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ prd.yaml
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ architecture.yaml
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ epics.yaml
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ stories.yaml
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tasks.csv
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backend-fastapi/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ web-express/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ summary.json
```

`summary.json` includes:
- Concept used, timestamps, loop count, QA strictness.
- Counts of stories by status (`done`, `blocked`, `pending`).
- Lists of story IDs per status for quick inspection.

## 6. Supporting Infrastructure

### 6.1 Core Pipeline Strengths (Quick View)

| Feature | Summary |
| ------- | ------- |
| **Integral TDD** | Tests are mandatory per story; QA blocks missing suites when `ALLOW_NO_TESTS=0`. |
| **Intelligent QA** | Severity-aware classification, automated architect interventions, and selective force approval. |
| **Auto-Retry + Dependencies** | Stories in `waiting` state unlock when prerequisites finish; Dev‚ÜíQA loops run via `make loop`. |
| **Cross-Stack Support** | Backend (FastAPI), web (Express.js), and new modules (React Native, services) supported through skeletons. |

### 6.2 Project Defaults Skeleton

`project-defaults/` provides a minimal scaffold copied into `project/` whenever missing:
- `backend-fastapi/app/__init__.py` ensures imports like `from app.foo import ...` always work.
- Placeholder test packages and `.gitkeep` files for web assets.
- Stub modules for FastAPI/Pydantic (optional) so QA runs even if dependencies are offline.

`common.ensure_dirs()` clones these defaults without overwriting existing files, meaning release loops always start from a consistent baseline after cleanup.

### 6.3 Multi-Stack Extensibility & Providers

- Roles are configured in `config.yaml`; each loop release can target Ollama, OpenAI, or Codex CLI per agent.
- Extending to new stacks (e.g., mobile apps, additional services) is as simple as adding a skeleton under `project-defaults/`‚Äîrelease loops will copy the structure automatically.
- `scripts/llm.py` handles provider selection per role, logging raw interactions under `artifacts/<role>/last_raw.txt`.
- Mix and match local (Ollama) or paid APIs (OpenAI, Claude Code, Codex CLI, etc.) within the same release; each role can target a different provider without code changes.

### 6.4 Architect Complexity Tiers

- The Architect agent inspects `planning/requirements.yaml` and chooses between three prompt tiers:
  - **Simple** ‚Äì 3‚Äë6 broad stories, high developer autonomy; triggered by lightweight/MVP requirements.
  - **Medium** ‚Äì Default backlog size (approx. 5‚Äë12 stories) with balanced detail.
  - **Corporate** ‚Äì 10‚Äë18 highly specified stories covering integrations, compliance, and non-functional requirements.
- Selection is primarily driven by an LLM classifier fed with the requirements text; a lightweight word-count fallback keeps the system resilient when the classifier is unavailable.
- Override manually when needed with `FORCE_ARCHITECT_TIER=<simple|medium|corporate> make plan`.
- The chosen tier is exposed in console logs (`Complexity tier selected: ...`) and passed to the LLM so outputs scale in detail automatically.

## 5. Getting Started (Strict Release)

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   make setup
   ```
2. **Set providers/models**
   ```bash
   make set-role role=architect provider=codex_cli model="gpt-5-codex"
   make set-role role=dev provider=ollama model="mistral:7b-instruct"
   ```
3. **Run a strict loop release**
   ```bash
   make iteration CONCEPT="CoffeeClub Inventory & Ordering" LOOPS=2 ALLOW_NO_TESTS=0
   ```
4. **Inspect results**
   ```bash
   cat artifacts/iterations/<iteration>/summary.json
   tree artifacts/iterations/<iteration>/
   ```
5. **Retry blocked stories**
   ```bash
   make loop MAX_LOOPS=1
   ```

---

## 6. Advanced Controls

| Flag | Purpose |
| ---- | ------- |
| `ALLOW_NO_TESTS` | TDD strictness (0 = strict, 1 = relaxed) |
| `ARCHITECT_INTERVENTION` | Enables auto story refinements when QA fails |
| `STRICT_TDD` | Forces Architect to embed additional TDD requirements |
| `LOOP_MODE=dev_only` | Skip QA for exploratory coding loops |
| `SKIP_BA` / `SKIP_PO` / `SKIP_PLAN` | Reuse existing outputs for incremental releases |

Use these flags in `make iteration` or directly in `make loop` for lower-level control.

## 7. Reference Commands

```bash
# One-off actions
make ba                          # BA ‚Üí requirements
make po                          # Product Owner ‚Üí vision + alignment review
make plan                        # Architect ‚Üí PRD, epics, stories, tasks
make dev STORY=S1                # Dev implements a specific story
make qa QA_RUN_TESTS=1           # Run QA with tests
make clean                       # Purge artifacts/ (FLUSH=1 also wipes planning/ and project/)

# Orchestration
make loop MAX_LOOPS=10           # Dev‚ÜîQA loop (includes Architect adjustments)
make iteration CONCEPT="..."     # Full loop release with snapshot

# Utilities

## 8. Proven Outcome

Loop releases have already generated:
- A full e-commerce platform (auth, catalog, cart, checkout) across 15 stories.
- >200 automated tests validated by QA in strict mode.
- Zero manual coding once the concept is defined.

---

## 9. Conclusion

Treat each loop release as a self-contained product increment: enter a concept, run `make iteration`, and receive code, tests, and documentation. The workflow is **simple to drive**, **powerful in coverage**, and **extensible to any stack or environment**‚Äîfrom hobby experiments to enterprise delivery. The AGNOSTIC AI PIPELINE turns this release cadence into a repeatable process that scales while maintaining audit-ready artifacts. üöÄ
