# AGNOSTIC AI PIPELINE 🏗️

**Enterprise-Grade AI Pipeline for Automated Application Generation**

Autonomous system that generates **complete commercial web applications** with integrated QA, Intelligent Architecture, and End-to-End Quality Cycles.

## 🔥 Main Features

- **🏆 INTEGRAL TDD**: Tests are mandatory part of each user story - no separate test stories
- **🧠 Intelligent QA**: Severity analysis for selective force-approval (only P1/P0 with valid reasons)
- **🔄 AUTO-RESTART**: Automatic quality assessment and rework when necessary
- **🎯 Intelligent Dependencies**: Stories automatically released when dependencies are completed
- **📊 Advanced Quality Gates**: Multiple states (debugging, quality_gate_waiting, blocked_various)
- **👐 Modular Architecture**: FastAPI + Express.js + Optional React Native
- **🚀 End-to-End Generation**: From business concept → deployable functional application

## 📊 Proven Results

**Generates complete applications:** 15 user stories → functional e-commerce (auth, catalog, cart, checkout) with >200 passing tests.

**Executions:**
```bash
15 stories completed in 13 iterations = 100% success rate
System demonstrated: Full TDD + Intelligent QA + Selective force-approval
```

## 🎯 System Differentiation

### ❌ Before (Basic Systems)
```yaml
- Some basic dev tool
- Optional/desynchronized tests
- Manual/blind force-approval
- Stories separated from quality
```

### ✅ Now (AGNOSTIC AI PIPELINE)
```yaml
- Mandatory TDD: integral tests in each story
- Intelligent QA: force-approval only for P1/P0 with severity analysis
- Dependency system: automatic release when dependencies complete
- Advanced Quality Gates: debugging, blocked_critical, quality_gate_waiting, etc.
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Optimized Setup
```bash
make setup
# Installs: httpx, PyYAML, typer, rich, pytest

make set-role role=ba        provider=ollama model="granite4:latest"
make set-role role=architect provider=ollama model="qwen2.5-coder:32b-instruct-q8_0"
make set-role role=dev       provider=ollama model="mistral:7b-instruct-v0.1"
make set-role role=qa        provider=ollama model="qwen2.5-coder:7b"
```

### 2. Business Concept → Complete Application
```bash
read -r -d '' CONCEPT <<'TXT'
Product: E-commerce MVP (FastAPI backend, Express.js frontend).
Features: signup/login, catalog, shopping cart, simulated checkout.
Goal: Mobile-first retail platform with quality focus.
TXT

# Execute complete pipeline
ALLOW_NO_TESTS=1 MAX_LOOPS=20 ARCHITECT_INTERVENTION=1 make ba plan loop
# Result: Complete application generated automatically
```

### 3. Iterative Development
```bash
# Automatically assess quality
make loop MAX_LOOPS=10

# With intelligent force-approval (only critical P1/P0)
ARCHITECT_INTERVENTION=1 make loop

# Development-only mode (no QA)
LOOP_MODE=dev_only make dev-loop
```

## 🏗️ Supported Architectures

### Full-Stack Web Application
```
Frontend: Express.js + Node.js
Backend: FastAPI + Python
Database: ORM (SQLAlchemy/SQLite)
Testing: pytest + Jest
```

### Enterprise E-commerce (Demonstrated)
- ✅ **Authentication**: User registration/login with 2FA
- ✅ **Catalog**: Product listing with search/filter
- ✅ **Shopping Cart**: Add/remove/update with totals
- ✅ **Checkout**: Simulated payment processing
- ✅ **Testing**: >200 automated tests

## 🔧 Advanced Features

### TDD Enforcement (Mandatory Test-Driven Development)
```yaml
# All stories REQUIRE integral tests:
- id: S1
  description: User registration with email verification
  acceptance:
    - User enters details and receives confirmation email
    - Verification redirects to login
  tests_required: true  # AUTOMATIC - not optional
```

### Intelligent QA Severity Analysis
```
❌ CRITICAL ERRORS (NEVER force-approve):
   - SyntaxError, ImportError, environment_fail

✅ FORCE-APPLICABLE (P1/P0 ≥3 iterations):
   - Coverage issues, timeout, temporary issues

🔧 TEST-ONLY (Code OK, tests fail):
   - Assertion failures, separate test stories
```

### Dependency Management System
```
✅ DEPENDENT STORY RELEASED:
   - Parent story ← quality_gate_waiting
   - Test story completes → parent ← todo automatically
   - Intelligent dependency system
```

### Advanced Quality Gates
```yaml
status: done                    # Successfully completed
status: blocked_fatal          # Critical errors - permanently blocked
status: done_force_architect    # Force-approved P1/P0 by architect
status: code_done_tests_pending # Code OK, tests separated
status: quality_gate_waiting   # Waiting for test validation
status: debug_only             # Debugging mode
```

## 📊 System Architectures

### Intelligent Pipeline Flow
```
BA (Business Analysis)
  ↓
Architect (Technical Planning + Test Integration)
  ↓
Dev (Code + Tests Generation)
  ↓
QA (TDD Validation + Severity Analysis)
  ↓
[I/F Loop] Architect Intervention (Intelligent force-approval)
  ↓
[NEXT CYCLE] Re-evaluation when ALL STORIES COMPLETE
```

### Quality Assurance Intelligence
```
❌ FAIL → SEVERITY ANALYSIS → APPROPRIATE PLACEMENT
✅ PASS → DEPENDENCY RESOLUTION → WAITING STORIES RELEASED
🔄 PERSISTENT → ESCALATION → ARCHITECT INTERVENTION
```
