Turn the short product CONCEPT into a developer-ready plan.

Output strictly in these fenced blocks (no extra prose):
```yaml PRD
# scope, roles, feature list
```
```yaml ARCH
# system architecture (components, APIs, data model)
```
```yaml EPICS
# - id: E1
#   name: ...
#   description: ...
#   priority: P1
```
```yaml STORIES
# - id: S1
#   epic: E1
#   description: ...
#   acceptance: ...
#   priority: P1
#   status: todo
```
```csv TASKS
id,story,title,detail,priority
T1,S1,Scaffold backend,Create FastAPI skeleton,P1
```
Guidelines: short IDs, implementable increments, reflect hinted stacks, no extra commentary.
