The term \"automation\"\n    from the concept is not yet translated into specific features beyond analytics.\n  conflicts:\n  - FR003 (Integrate with Workday) is a potential conflict. Workday is an HR/Finance\n    system, and its relevance to a telemedicine triage workflow is unclear. This integration\n    could add significant complexity without contributing to the core value proposition\n    unless a specific, unstated business case exists.\nrecommended_actions:\n- For FR003: Request clarification on the business purpose of the Workday integration.\n    Specify what data needs to be synchronized and how it directly supports the patient\n    triage process. Consider deferring this if it is not essential for the initial\n    release.\n- For the automation gap: Propose adding new functional requirements that define the\n    triage automation, such as rule-based case assignment, automated priority flagging\n    based on submitted data, or automated status notifications.\nnarrative: The requirements are largely consistent with the vision for a triage and\n  analytics portal for non-profits. However, the plan needs adjustment. The core promise\n  of \"automation\" is currently underspecified, requiring new requirements to define\n  how the system will streamline workflows. Furthermore, the Workday integration (FR003)\n  seems out of scope for a patient-centric triage tool and needs justification to\n  ensure it aligns with the product's primary goals.\n```"}
